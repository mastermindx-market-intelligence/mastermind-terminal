# AUTHORING SOURCE: ops/terminal-build.sh in the repo. The deployed copy at
# /opt/terminal/terminal-build.sh is installed from master by step 8 of every
# deploy (effective the NEXT run) — edit via PR, never in place on the box.
#
# One deploy ships TWO kinds of code from the same origin/master SHA (see DEPLOY.md):
#   1. the Next.js app: terminal/ -> staged build -> atomic .next swap
#   2. runtime code consumed by cron + systemd OUTSIDE the app:
#        ingest/ scripts/ config/ contracts/ hub/ signal_layer/
#                                                 (overlay, tracked files only)
#        ops/terminal-data     -> /usr/local/bin/terminal-data     (nightly cron)
#        ops/terminal-build.sh -> /opt/terminal/terminal-build.sh  (next deploy)
#      signal_layer/ synced since the 2026-07-10 reconciliation (box GC-v2 engine
#      committed, incl. confluence_v2.py) — master is canonical. See DEPLOY.md.
#
# Zero-downtime: builds into a staging tree, atomic-swaps `.next` only after the
# build verifies (BUILD_ID present); the live server keeps serving until the swap.
# Auto-rolls-back to the previous build if the new one fails its health check.
# If the deploy fails at any step, NOTHING moves — app AND runtime code stay put.

# ── deploy generation: the identity and the build it names move together ──────
# .deployment-id and the .next it describes are ONE generation. Installing the
# marker before the swap and then rolling back only .next leaves the box serving
# the OLD build while .gitsrc HEAD and .deployment-id both read the NEW commit —
# so a verifier trusting source-HEAD + marker certifies a deploy that was rolled
# back, and only .next/BUILD_ID still witnesses what is actually live. Every
# marker mutation below is therefore paired with a same-filesystem rollback
# record, and rollback restores identity and build together or reports neither:
#   .deployment-id.bak      exact prior marker (cp -p keeps bytes AND metadata)
#   .deployment-id.absent   sentinel — there was no prior marker, so rollback deletes
#   .deployment-id.new      staged marker, never left behind
# tests/test_terminal_build_rollback.py sources this file to drive the state machine
# against a temp dir; sourcing stops at the guard below and deploys nothing.

# caller knows a restart is mandatory even when the identity is unresolved.

# .next/BUILD_ID is the SAME string before and after every deploy and every
# rollback: here it proves the live .next is present and complete, and it does NOT
# discriminate an old build from a new one.
#
# What makes this gate discriminating is the MARKER, and only because rollback now
# restores it (deploy_generation_rollback). After a rolled-back deploy the marker
# reads the previous SHA, so live_marker != want_sha and this returns non-zero —
# which is exactly the certification failure the old script could not produce.
# Keep all three compared anyway: the BUILD_ID leg is cheap, it catches a truncated
# or missing .next, and it stays correct if deploymentId is ever removed.
