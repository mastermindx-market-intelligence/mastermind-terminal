/**
 * Short-TTL, POSITIVE-ONLY entitlement cache.
 *
 * WHY: one cold /options load resolves entitlement SEVEN times — the page render
 * (app/(shell)/options/page.tsx), five /api/flow GETs and the /api/flow/stream
 * open. Each resolution is a cross-origin `GET {BILLING_BASE}/api/me` measured at
 * ~0.5 s TTFB, and because the client's fetch waves are serial those six
 * duplicates land directly on the critical path.
 *
 * THE AUTHORITY DOES NOT MOVE. macro-api still decides; this only stops us asking
 * it the same question about the same access token six more times inside one page
 * load. The contract that keeps that safe:
 *
 *   - keyed by SHA-256 of the caller's access token, so one user's answer can
 *     never satisfy another user's gate — and no raw JWT is retained in the map;
 *   - only a POSITIVE answer is stored. A null (unauthed / non-2xx / network
 *     error) and an answer that fails the calling gate are never cached, so a
 *     fail-closed "no" is always re-derived from the authority and a freshly
 *     upgraded user is never stuck behind the paywall;
 *   - TTL 45 s (inside the specced 30–60 s band): a revocation can lag by at most
 *     one TTL, the same bound the /api/flow payload cache already runs on;
 *   - in-flight dedup collapses the concurrent gates of one page load onto a
 *     single upstream call;
 *   - `isPaidTier()` — the Pine-script SAVE gate — deliberately does NOT use it.
 *     Write paths keep resolving fresh.
